This is my artificial intelligence side project that I created to practice and expand my knowledge on machine learning and algorithms. 
It uses a MySQL database to store its data and then utilizes the functions and methods I have coded to sort that data out. 
This also gave me practice into working with more advanced data structures, such as Trees and Maps.

## Prerequisites

You will need Java and MySQL to work on this project. Currently, I am using the Eclipse IDE to manage and track my Java
packages and project.

## Setting It Up

Take a look within the AIFramework.java main method. You will see the contingency prompts that I hard-coded.
Before you can use these commands, the word learning algorithm will ask you to identify these words. The words
that are used within the contigency prompts that refer to commands are referred to as protected words. Thus,
when you are asked if this word is a protected word, type "y" or "yes".

```
Is this a protected word?
>> yes
```
